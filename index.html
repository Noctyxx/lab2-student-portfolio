            <h4>February 25, 2026</h4>
            <p>Due to heavy workloads, today we just started building our basic website using HTML.
                It was worrisome at first, for I do not know what to do at first considering we need
                to use GitHub for this activity. But with some basic tutorial from YouTube, I eventually
                got it. But the commands were a bit lengthy for me so I need more time to study the 
                the algorithm. This concludes my commit today.
