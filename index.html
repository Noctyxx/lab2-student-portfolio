            <h4>February 25, 2026</h4>
            <p>Due to heavy workloads, today we just started building our basic website using HTML.
                It was worrisome at first, for I do not know what to do at first considering we need
                to use GitHub for this activity. But with some basic tutorial from YouTube, I eventually
                got it. But the commands were a bit lengthy for me so I need more time to study the 
                algorithm. This concludes my commit today.

            <h4>February 25, 2026</h4>
            <p>Yesterday, we had a very hard time navigating through GitHub's settings, but all in all it was a blast.
                My partner and I got the best bonding trip out of all that hassle. We finally learned how to
                commit using the terminal in VS Code and view the logs in Git Bash. Today, there is nothing
                much to do but to double check for errors. This concludes my commit today.

            <h4>September 25, 2026</h4>
            <p>Due to quizzes and workloads, today we just started building our activity in Web Systems.
                I was worried earlier because maybe we wont finish it on time, but me and my partner will 
                do our very best to create basic website using HTML and CSS. The github is kinda complicated
                but I hope I master this process especially in committing. It's quite challenging to use 
                github but I hope we will get use to it. This is end of my commit today.
